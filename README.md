Tikal Test for android developers
=================================

This is a simple app as Tikal specified, loading movies information and displaying it.
The app is very basic but tries to show correct usage of Andriod architectural components such as Room and LiveData, as well as third party libraries.

* The app is written in Kotlin for the most part.
* The app adapts to tablet view.
* The data is cached in a local DB.
* LiveData is used.

### Future work:
* Adding data to be loaded on splashscreen (such as genres and languages).
* Adding search feature.
* adding "infinity scroll" using android paging component.

### Screenshots
